# Topics in Computer Vision and Deep Learning

Collection of my personal summaries of Computer Vision and Deep Learning papers. The summaries are intended to be based solely on the original paper with just the key insights for my personal archive. I try to summarize at least one paper per week and organize relevant publications on each topic in a chronological order.
