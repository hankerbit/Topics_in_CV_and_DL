# Topics in Computer Vision and Deep Learning

Collection of my personal summaries of Computer Vision and Deep Learning papers. The summaries are intended to be based solely on the original paper with just the key insights for my personal archive. I try to summarize at least one paper per week and organize relevant publications on each topic in a chronological order. 

## Point Cloud Methods

Point Clouds are among the most widely spread data representations in 3D Computer Vision. Generated by LiDAR sensors or RGB-D scanners, they provide highly accurate depth information. However, due to the continuous representation space, standard convolutions known from the image domain cannot be applied. Consequently, a variety of methods have been proposed that rely on either voxelization, Birds-Eye-View projection or direct processing of the continuous point cloud.
Publications in [Section 1](#object-detection-for-autonomous-driving) will focus on 3D and BEV object detection from point clouds with a focus on autonomous driving applications. [Section 2](#point-nets) presents PointNet architectures designed to process the continous point cloud directly using MLPs.

## Depth Estimation

The area of depth estimation is concerned with the extraction of depth information from either mono or stereo camera images. As all 3D Computer Vision tasks rely on accurate depth information, algorithms for depth estimation from image data are highly relevant to help close the performance gap between image-based methods and approaches that leverage information obtained by 3D-sensor such as LiDAR sensors or RGB-D scanners. Publications mainly focus on depth estimation in the context of 3D object detection for autonomous driving.

## Uncertainty Estimation

Being able to reliably assess the uncertainty of a prediction made by a deep learning model is highly important for the use in safety-critical scenarios. The field of uncertainty estimation focusses on the extraction of probability distributions rather than single point estimates by combining deep learning with the probabilistic bayesian framework.
Publications include Bayesian Neural Networks as well as approximation strategies and calibration methods that ensure interpretable neural network outputs.
